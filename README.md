An addon mod for [Ripples of the Past](https://github.com/StandoByte/Ripples-of-the-Past), a mod for Minecraft based on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

## Mod developer's (StandoByte) note
Right now the dependency on the main mod is achieved by literally putting the mod's file into the libs/ directory of the project, which isn't the best. I know that mod developers are supposed to publish their mod's source into a Maven repository (or something along these lines), but I didn't figure out how to do that yet. So I would appreciate any tips from an experienced developers - if you would like to help, contact me on [the mod's Discord](https://discord.gg/4GcjnMnXP4) or open an issue in the repository.
